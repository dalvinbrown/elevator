          Henry Ladson, 67, hasn’t gone to the grocery store in three weeks. And he’s upset about it. 

The nearest bodega is just footsteps away from the entrance to his building at 751 Gerard Ave. and a local Key Foods isn’t much further.

          “Distance isn’t really the problem,” the Bronx resident who works for the Board of Education said. “The problem is the damn inconsistent elevator is broken down. I have some problems with my knees and the stairs plus the heavy bags make everything worse.”

The Bronx has more elevator breakdowns than any other borough, according to 311 complaints. Ladson is among the boroughs residents who say they are fed up. 

        </p>
        For disabled tenants, broken elevators mean being stranded inside apartments or lobbies for hours – even days. Others complain that faulty machines encourage people to abandon garbage in the hallways, and some residents said they’re stuck footing the bill for elevators that are consistently out of service.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          When Ladson moved to the six-story building in the Concourse neighborhood, the elevators ran smoothly for years. That was 20-years-ago.

                  }
              });

          “Ever since Ved Parkash took over, I want to say 8-years-ago, it’s just been a mess. Inconsistent. Mess,” Ladson said. He files 311 complaints against the landlord every time the lift gets stuck in the basement. He eats out more often so he doesn’t have to lug groceries home.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Ladson also said inconsistent elevators encourage elderly people to leave trash in the building’s corridors rather than taking the garbage to the basement where it belongs.  “They can’t take the stairs either. And you can smell their trash on the other floors. That attracts bad smells and lots of rats,” Ladson said. His building has the second-highest number of complaints in the city over the last year. 
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Parkash didn’t respond to request for comment, however, he was voted as the city’s worst landlord in 2015, according to the Right to Counsel NYC Coalition. Rodent infestation was one of the main grievances lodged against him by tenants.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Charles Green, who leads a tenant watch organization in the Fordham area, said his wheelchair-bound mother has missed doctor’s appointments because she can’t take the stairs. The elevator in the NYCHA-owned building has left her stuck in the apartment for days, Green said
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “The most recent episode was just last week,” Green said. He is his mother’s primary caregiver. “We actually had to call the fire department once to help her get of out the elevator. It broke down with her in it. The landlord had just said he fixed it, and approximately two hours later she was stuck.” 


        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Anita Long, another Fordham resident, has lived on the first floor of a six-story building since the ‘90s.

 In 2015, new management took over, renovated and received state approval to offset construction costs to tenants. Long’s rent was raised $200 per month after the owners installed a new elevator.


        </p>
<p class="g-copy">“I got stuck paying for an elevator I don’t even use,” Long said. “Even if I wanted to use it, I couldn’t because it still doesn’t work. It’s unfair.” She joined a community-based organization that hosts mock trials to testify against landlords for improperly maintaining residential buildings.

  Elevators can cost an owner more than $100,000 to fix in a six-story building, according to Jay Nolan, an elevator consultant at Sierra Consulting Group in Long Island.
  </p>
  <p class="g-copy">“It’s usually a numbers game,” said Jordan Cooper, a community organizer at Community Action for Safe Apartments. “It’s most common in buildings with a large number of rent-stabilized tenants. Either landlords are trying to force tenants out by letting a building deteriorate or they patch things up, hike rents then price them out.”

    Still, Ladson, Green and Long plan on remaining in the Bronx for years to come because the borough is home.
